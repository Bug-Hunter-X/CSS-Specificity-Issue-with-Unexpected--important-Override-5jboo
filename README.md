# CSS Specificity Bug
This repository demonstrates a subtle and uncommon bug related to CSS specificity and the `!important` declaration.  The issue is that `!important` unexpectedly overrides styles with what appears to be higher specificity.  This is a difficult-to-debug scenario, potentially due to the ordering of stylesheets, inheritance, or browser-specific interpretations of specificity.  The solution explores a better approach to avoid such conflicts.

## Bug Description
The bug involves unexpected styling behavior where a less specific selector seemingly overrides a more specific one due to the presence of `!important`.  This defies typical CSS specificity rules.  The root cause appears to be the interaction of the `!important` flag with multiple stylesheets or complex inheritance, leading to non-intuitive style application.

## Solution
The solution demonstrates cleaner styling, avoiding the overuse of `!important` and utilizing more specific selectors to achieve the intended styling without unexpected behavior.
