The CSS code has an unusual specificity issue.  The selector `.container .item` has lower specificity than expected, causing the style to be overridden by a more generic selector. This can be challenging to debug because the order of stylesheets or the presence of inheritance can mask the true cause.  The specific problem lies in the unexpected behavior of the `!important` declaration in the overriding stylesheet.
